They  are  variously  described  as  ideas, notions,  concepts,  impressions,  perceptions,  views,  beliefs,  opinions,  values,  and  so  on.  At times  they  are  brief,  coming  and  going  in  an  instant.  On  other  occasions  they  seem  to endure and we  can mull them over again and again in the act  we  call thinking. We can put them  aside,  fall  asleep,  and  then  return  to  them  later.  We  refer  to  them  as  things  we  can handle. However, this is just a metaphor. "

    "text":"The lime green coat with piping. She loves the way the coat shines, the contrast of greens, the acid of the lime against the pine-colored braids. Grit under her feet mixed with mud. The wind screaming, leaves scattering against her skin. A puddle. Clouds reflected, dizzy, the silvery light and her face, blurred. Not hard-edged and glass cold, a mirror to talk back like the boys on the street. Who’s got an ugly mug? Boyfriend didn’t like you, eh? She touches the scarred skin. Tree roots and lightning, brilliant. Reflected in the water there is only her own illuminated beauty."

By noon, when the rain comes down in sheets, and the last of the leaves die off, you have moved to your fibula, working up to your femur. Not yet fifteen, you have an ageless resilience towards suffering, calling upon ancient curses that burn themselves on the backs of my eyelids, a list of all the mistakes I have made. The ways I didn’t protect you, and still am not."
